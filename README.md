## 📌 Description

Volunteer Connect is a software system to improve volunteer management processes for social and civic welfare volunteer activities in the Paranaque City Area.

The system will allow volunteers to search for volunteer program opportunities based on their desired interests and availability. It will include a user-friendly interface that will streamline the volunteer application process, allowing volunteers to apply for activities that resonate with them. The system will also authorize organizations to manage their program schedule and desired number of volunteers.
